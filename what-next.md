# What next?

The library is built to be "pluggable", using **variants**. However, the first two variants come from a Phoenix/Ecto [app of mine](https://github.com/marick/crit19/). Because of that, it makes more sense to explain the **Ecto Classic variant** \(the simpler of the two\) first, rather than start with an explanation that applies to any possible variant.

{% hint style="info" %}
I haven't started extracting the second variant, the Ecto View Model variant, from the app's original version of this library.
