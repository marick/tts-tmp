# What the libary is for

This Ecto Test DSL provides a **declarative domain-specific-language** for checkable examples \(that is, **tests**\) of **Ecto database operations,** particularly those that **back HTML forms** handled via **Phoenix.**

The language relies on the fact that most transformations are pretty rote. Lots and lots of Ecto transformations follow the same steps:

1. Accept a form, producing a changeset.
2. If the changeset is invalid, ask the user to try again using `error` fields in the changeset.
3. Otherwise, insert or update the database.
4. ... which may fail with database constraint errors, which should also be reported to the user or client in `error` fields. 

A lot of this rote code _could_ be easier to test than to write – rote code generally is – but it's usually not, often because of fiddly setup. This library aims to achieve that ease of test-writing, while also **supporting tests different enough that they shouldn't be declarative**. That is, the library should do the boring part of such tests, making you write imperative test code only for the interesting part. 

There are other requirements: 

1. The library **fits into a test-driven design workflow.** 
2. **It uses the ExUnit framework as much as possible.** For example, individual examples are run as ExUnit `tests`, even though they don't use the notation, and individual failures are produced using the ExUnit reporting mechanism.
3. **Tests produce error messages as good as ExUnit assertions do.** \(Wrappers of test frameworks often don't.\)
4. **Tests are just Elixir code.** \(This DSL is what's called an [internal DSL](https://javieracero.com/blog/internal-vs-external-dsl/).\)  Nevertheless, you can write tests that are correct Elixir but incorrect in this DSL. So a requirement is that **the DSL parser produces good error messages.** A confusing error message is a bug.
5. It is relatively easy to **support different rote transformations**. For example, my personal form handling code doesn't follow the four step workflow shown above. Instead of a single `schema` structure, I use two: one outward-facing, tailored to the form, and one inward-facing, tailored to the database layout. So the same library supports both **variants**.
6. While leaning on [**convention over configuration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration), it is possible to **override conventions** when \(1\) the overrides are fairly common and \(2\) overriding can be done without too much complication \(otherwise, it's better to fall back to imperative test code\). For example, it should be easy to say "Use this function instead of `Repo.insert` to insert new database records."
